# My Philosophy, Mission and Goals

I am a **_self taught_** `developer` who got into `web development` **_early
on_** out of **_need_**. At the time, i **_could not find_** anyone to
**_build_** what I **_wanted built_**, so I **_taught myself_** to do it.
**_Much later_**, with the **_advent_** of `Bootcamps` and `"Coding Schools"`, I
**_went back_** to **_further_** my **_knowledge_** and **_skills_**.

My `path` is **_not_** a **_traditional one_**. I have a **_background_** in
`Graphic Design`, `Video`, and `Digital Photography`. **_Now_** I **_build
things_** for the `Web` and **_teach others_** how to **_do_** the **_same_**. I
**_also_** `acquaint people` with their `OS`, `Git`, `Command Line`, and
`Digital Software` **_programs_** on `macOS`.

I `have built` and `taught` **_all things_** `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

I am **_passionate_** about **_all things_** `Git` and `Command Line`.

I feel it **_important_** that `people` (or `students`) become **_better
acquainted_** with their `operating systems` and **_understand_** how they
**_work_** `under` the `hood`, and what **_better way_** than the
`Command Line`! In **_addition_**, `Command Line` is **_essential_** for
`developers` **_working with_** a `variety` of `developer tools`.

I **_believe_** in `designing`, `developing`, and `teaching` **_experiences_**
that **_make_** `people's lives` **_simpler_**.

I **_take_** a **_very_** `hands` on `approach`, and **_believe_** in
**_learning_** by **_doing_**. My `teaching background` is in the
**_traditional_** (**_college_**) **_classroom_**. **_Now_** I **_would like_**
to **_apply_** my `philosophy` and `mission` **_outside of_** the
`traditional classroom`!

`Teaching online` **_permitted me_** to **_cover_** `subject matter` and in the
**_way_** that I **_felt_** is **_most appropriate_** that a
`traditional classroom` **_would not_**. The **_aim_** of this `course` is for
`students` to **_gain_** `broader knowledge` and `skills` that **_make them_**
more **_competitive_**.

**_Hope_** to **_see you_** in **_my course_** `entitled`
["A Comprehensive Guide to Front End Web development"](https://interglobalmedianetwork-site-84aa.thinkific.com/courses/comprehensive-guide-to-front-end-web-development),
which I **_just published_** on
[thinkific.com](https://interglobalmedianetwork-site-84aa.thinkific.com/courses/comprehensive-guide-to-front-end-web-development!
Yu can **_learn more_** about the `course` and **_what_** is **_built_** by
**_watching_** the `video` on the `course site`'s **_home page_**.

## Switching into the field of CyberSecurity

The advent of `npm audit`, and the exponential increase in cyber attacks during
and after the Covid 19 pandemic inspired me to pursue a career in the field of
CyberSecurity. In October 2023, I completed the
`Google CyberSecurity certificate program` on `Coursera`, and I am **_currently
enrolled_** in the `Rochester Institute of Technology`'s
`Cybersecurity MicroMasters certificate program` **_via_** `edX` online.

My `ideal position` would be as an `entry level digital analyst`, and my
`first area` of `interest` is `digital` or `computer forensics`. I am o`pen` to
`part time`, `full time`, and `paid internship opportunities` in
`Cybersecurity`.

Please be sure to also `visit` my `personal blog`
[mariadcampbell.com](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/), `where` I `blog` about
`CyberSecurity`, `fullstack development`, as `well` as `macOS`, `Command Line`,
`Git`, and `ethics` in `technology`.

`About` **_ME_**? **_When_** Iâ€™m **_not_** `coding`, I **_love_** to **_go_** to
the `countryside` to **_recharge_**, **_watch_** `Film Noir` and
`mystery movies`, **_listen_** to `alternative` and `soul music`, **_ponder
over_** `surrealist art`, and **_create_** `exotic cuisine`.
