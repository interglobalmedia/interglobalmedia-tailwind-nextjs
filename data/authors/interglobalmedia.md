# My Philosophy, Mission and Goals

I `build` and `teach` **_all things_** `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

I am **_passionate_** about **_all things_** `Git` and `Command Line`.

I feel it **_important_** that `people` (`students`) become **_better acquainted_** with their `operating systems` and **_understand_** how they **_work_** `under` the `hood`, and what **_better way_** than the `Command Line`! In **_addition_**, `Command Line` is **_essential_** for `developers` **_working with_** a `variety` of `developer tools`.

I `teach` on **_two_** `operating systems`. `Windows` and `macOS`. I **_work_** on **_both_** myself. I **_discovered_** that **_more_** and **_more_** of my `students` were **_using_** `Windows`, and I **_did not_** want to **_exclude_** that `population`. I **_cover_** the `Windows CMD Prompt` and `PowerShell`, `Git`, `Node.js` and `npm`. **_Everything_** `macOS users` **_install_** and **_use_**, the `Windows` users **_install_** the **_equivalent_** of and **_use_** as well. This makes teaching **_all inclusive_**.

I take a **_very_** `hands on approach`, and **_believe_** in **_learning_** by **_doing_**. I am a **_strong proponent_** of the [Maker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture#:~:text=The%20maker%20culture%20is%20a,general%20supports%20open%2Dsource%20hardware.) as **_regards_** `Web Development`, and my **_goal_** is to **_foster_** it in my `teaching` **_and_** `building`.

**_Since_** the `onset` of `COVID-19`, I **_began_** `teaching seniors` **_about_** their `computers` **_too_**. I **_have found_** `senior students` **_can_** be **_very eager_** and **_quick_** to `learn`.

> `Teaching` is **_great_**, but there is **_nothing like_** `building applications`, **_especially_** as `part` of a `team`, which are **_useful_** to others and **_contribute_** to **_bettering_** and/or **_making_** `their lives` **_simpler_**!

`About` **_ME_**? **_When_** Iâ€™m **_not_** `coding`, I **_love_** to **_go_** to the `countryside` to **_recharge_**, **_watch_** `Film Noir` and `mystery movies`, **_listen_** to `alternative` and `soul music`, **_ponder over_** `surrealist art`, and **_create_** `exotic cuisine`.
