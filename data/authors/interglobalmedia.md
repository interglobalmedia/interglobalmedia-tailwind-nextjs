# My Philosophy, Mission and Goals

I am a **_self taught_** `developer` who got into `web development` **_early
on_** out of **_need_**. At the time, i **_could not find_** anyone to
**_build_** what I **_wanted built_**, so I **_taught myself_** to do it.
**_Much later_**, with the **_advent_** of `Bootcamps` and `"Coding Schools"`, I
**_went back_** to **_further_** my **_knowledge_** and **_skills_**.

My `path` is **_not_** a **_traditional one_**. I have a **_background_** in
`Graphic Design`, `Video`, and `Digital Photography`. **_Now_** I **_build
things_** for the `Web` and **_teach others_** how to **_do_** the **_same_**. I
**_also_** `acquaint people` with their `OS`, `Git`, `Command Line`,
`Digital Software` **_programs_** on `macOS`, and **_show them_** how to
**_effectively_** `collaborate` **_remotely_** with others **_using_** those
**_tools_**. If **_nothing else_**, the `Pandemic` **_revealed_** the
**_importance_** of being **_being able_** to **_communicate remotely_** with
others **_using_** various forms of **_technology_**. And **_also_** the
**_importance_** of **_some form_** of `COMMUNITY` **_for all_**.

I `have built` and `taught` **_all things_** `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

I am **_passionate_** about **_all things_** `Git` and `Command Line`.

I feel it **_important_** that `people` (or `students`) become **_better
acquainted_** with their `operating systems` and **_understand_** how they
**_work_** `under` the `hood`, and what **_better way_** than the
`Command Line`! In **_addition_**, `Command Line` is **_essential_** for
`developers` **_working with_** a `variety` of `developer tools`.

I `have taught` on **_two_** `operating systems`. `Windows` and `macOS`. I
**_work_** on **_both_** myself. I **_discovered_** that **_more_** and
**_more_** of my `students` were **_using_** `Windows`, and I **_did not_** want
to **_exclude_** that `population`. I **_covered_** the `Windows CMD Prompt` and
`PowerShell`, `Git`, `Node.js` and `npm`. **_Everything_** `macOS users`
**_installed_** and **_useed_**, the `Windows` users **_installed_** the
**_equivalent_** of and **_used_** as well. This **_made_** the `teaching`
**_all inclusive_**.

I took a **_very_** `hands on approach`, and **_believe_** in **_learning_** by
**_doing_**. I am a **_strong proponent_** of the
[Maker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture#:~:text=The%20maker%20culture%20is%20a,general%20supports%20open%2Dsource%20hardware.)
as **_regards_** `Web Development`, and my **_goal_** was (and **_still_** is)
to **_foster_** it in my `teaching` **_and_** `building`.

**_Since_** the `onset` of `COVID-19`, I **_began_** `teaching seniors`
**_about_** their `computers` **_too_**. I **_have found_** `senior students`
**_CAN_** be **_very eager_** and **_quick_** to `learn`.

> `Teaching` is **_great_**, but there is **_nothing like_** >
> `building applications`, **_especially_** as `part` of a `team`, or **_helping
> others_** `find solutions` to their **_technological issues_**, which are
> **_useful_** to **_them_** and **_contribute_** to **_bettering_** and/or
> **_making_** `their lives` **_simpler_**!

`About` **_ME_**? **_When_** Iâ€™m **_not_** `coding`, I **_love_** to **_go_** to
the `countryside` to **_recharge_**, **_watch_** `Film Noir` and
`mystery movies`, **_listen_** to `alternative` and `soul music`, **_ponder
over_** `surrealist art`, and **_create_** `exotic cuisine`.
