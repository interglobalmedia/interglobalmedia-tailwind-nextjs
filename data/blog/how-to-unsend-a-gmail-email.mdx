I was under the impression that only the iMessages app on macOS Ventura provided
the undo send feature. Well, apparently, it is becoming a “thing” everywhere.
But an interesting fact I just found out, was that Gmail has had `this` feature
`for` quite a long time! Man, I wish I had known about `this` back `in` the day!

The undo send email feature `in` Gmail `for` Web was officially rolled out `in`
2015, but `for` six years prior to the launch, it was available `as`
experimental feature. Shows how much attention I was paying to Gmail intricacies
at the time! Teaching others makes one much more hyper aware of what is
available at one’s fingertips, so to speak! However, while it was an
experimental feature, you did have to manually enable Gmail Labs in order to
gain access to it.

Unsending an email in Gmail is very simple. After you send an email to someone
via Gmail Web, the following appears:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia

	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_sent.webpb"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

When I click “Undo", the following appears:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_undone.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Screenshot of what appears after an email has just been unsent via Gmail"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_undone.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

However, what does not seem to be stated anywhere, is that the unsent email is
not forever deleted, it reverts to a draft`!` So `in` order to get rid `of` it
forever, you have to go into your Gmail “Drafts” folder and permanently `delete`
it there`!` The unsent email appears `in` the ”Drafts” folder. Something like
the following:

<br />

<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_undone_draft.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Screenshot of what appears after an email has just been unsent and reverted to a draft via Gmail"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_undone_draft.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

In the early days `of` the feature, you have to manually enable it `in` your
Gmail settings. Now, it is enabled by `default`. And there is no option to turn
it off. Why would you want to anyway?

The `default` delay for unsending a Gmail email is 5 seconds. But that really
does not necessarily give you time to think about whether you want to unsend the
email or not! I set it to the longest period `of` time possible, which is 30
seconds. In order to change the delay period, you have to click on the “Gear”
icon `in` your Gmail for web, and the following appears:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_unsend_gmail_settings_icon.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Screenshot of what happens when the user clicks on the Gmail settings icon"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_email_unsend_gmail_settings_icon.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

THEN, you have to click on “See all settings”. And the following appears:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_unsend_email_all_settings.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Screenshot of what appears after clicking on All Settings in Gmail"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_unsend_email_all_settings.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

As you can see, within the General tab, which is where you are directed to by
`default`, is the Unsend option. I selected “30 seconds”, but the following
options are also available:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_unsend_settings_unsend_options.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Screenshot of All Gmail Settings"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/gmail_unsend_settings_unsend_options.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

If you have set up your macOS Mail app to receive your Gmail emails, when you
unsend an email there, it will also be reverted to a draft. You will have to go
into your “Drafts” folder there and manually delete the draft as well.

I will also be writing a post on unsending a Gmail email on iPhone. The UX there
is a bit different, and I found it especially important to increase the delay
period to the max available, because otherwise, if the period is too short, like
5 seconds for example, there is a chance you don’t even see the “Undo Send” pop
up appear.

**_Happy unsending Gmail emails!_**
