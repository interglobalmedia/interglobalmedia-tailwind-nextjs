**_Recently_** I was **_introduced_** to the `npkill node module` on `Twitter`
by [T. Eric Cabrel](https://twitter.com/tericcabrel):

what a **great idea** and **tool** it is! I have **_so many_** `projects` on my
**laptop** that **_use_** `npm`. And do you **_know_** how much `disk space`
they were **taking up**? `34GB`. `34GB`! That is a `MEGALOAD` of `disk space`!

As long as you have `Node.js` and `npm` **_installed_**, it is **_very easy_**
to **use**. I **_decided_** to **_remove_** `10GB` for **_starters_**. This is
**_what_** I **_had_** to **_do_**:

**_First_**, I had to **_install_** the `package`. I did **_not_** actually
**_permanently_** install it, because I did **_not want_** to **install** it
`globally`, but just **_temporarily_** `download` it. That is because I was
**_not attaching_** it to any **_specific project_** or `folder`. That then
meant **using** the `npx` command prefix.

What is [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx)?

According to [npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx),

> (The `npx` command prefix) ...allows you to run an arbitrary command from an
> npm package (either one installed locally, or fetched remotely) in a similar
> context as running it via `npm run`.

What this **_really means_** is that if you **_want_** to **_use_** the
`latest version` of a `package` **_without installing_** it `globally` (which is
`permanent` until you **_choose_** to `delete` it **_manually_**), you can
**_use_** `npx` before the `command` you **_want_** to `execute`.

I **ran** the `npx npkill -d development` command in order to **_temporarily
install_** `npkill` and **_use_** it in my `development` **directory**. The
**_first time_** I **ran** the `command`, I was **_prompted_** as to **whether**
I **_wanted_** to `install` it or `not`. I **_responded_** by pressing the `y`
key for `yes`. After that, I was **_no longer_** prompted. `npx`
**_automatically_** `re-installed` the `package` **_without asking_**.

**_After_** `npkill` is **_installed_** something like the **_following_**
should appear in your `Terminal` **_window_**:

The `"space saved"` should **_initially show_** `"0"`, because **_no space_**
is`"initially saved"`. As **_indicated_** in the `screenshot`, I **_already_**
have `deleted` two instances of `node_modules` when I **_took_** this
`screenshot`.

The `process` is **_very easy_**, and **_tells_** you **_what_** to **_do_**.
The `instructions` are **_highlighted_** in `yellow`. The **_following_** is
what my `Terminal` **window instance** looked like **_after_** I **_deleted_**
`2.86GB` worth of `node_modules`:

And **_that_** is **_it_**!
