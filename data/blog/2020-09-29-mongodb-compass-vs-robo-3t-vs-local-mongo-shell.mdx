Lately, I have been working on a **backend** `REST API` using **Node.js**,
**Express**, and **MongoDB**. My **_initial_** **go-to** for **accessing** my
`local` **database** was the `Mongo Shell` and `MongoDB Compass`. **_However_**,
at **one point** I was **working** with `binary` **image** `data`, and
`MongoDB Compass` was **not able** to **provide** me with the **_complete_**
`binary` **data**. It was **_too long_** for it to **handle**! It **_only_**
**provided** me with a **small**, **initial chunk**. And _BTW_, the `binary`
**data** is **too long** to **show up** **_completely_** in `Terminal` as well.

So I **switched** to `Robo 3T`, which IS **able** to **handle** `binary`
**image** `data`. What did I **learn** from this? **_Perhaps_** when **working**
`locally`, `Robo 3T` is **better** to **use**, but when **working** in
**production**, `MongoDB Compass` is better.

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with
a **transcript** in the **_form_** of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
