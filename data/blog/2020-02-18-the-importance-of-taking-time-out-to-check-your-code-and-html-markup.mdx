I am noticing more and more that developers, new and experienced, rush to get
their code deployed or sent for review, etc., and don't check their code
carefully before doing so. As a result, silly errors, which could cause not so
silly issues, are overlooked. This means sloppy code.

It is so important to check your code as you go along. `JavaScript linters` such
as `ESLint for VS Code` (that is the editor I use, for example),
`Prettier Formatter for VS Code` for `JavaScript` **code formatting** are
**_helpful_** and **_important_** to **have**, but oftentimes, the **errors**
**_reside_** in the `html`! It is **_equally important_** to **check** for
**_errors_** in the `html` **markup**. There are **_three_**
`VS Code extensions` I find **extremely helpful** in **_checking for errors_**
in `html` **markup**:

-   `HTMLHint VS Code` **extension** by **_Mike Kaufman_**
-   `Code Spell Checker` **extension** by **_Street Side Software_**
-   `Highlight Matching Tag` **extension** by **_vincasIt_**

`HTMLHint` is a **static code analysis tool** for `HTML`. The way it works is
that **_errors_** in `HTML` **files** are **_highlighted_** with
`squiggly lines` and you can **_hover_** **over** the `squiggly lines` to see
the **error message**. `HTMLHint` will **_only analyze_** the **currently open**
`HTML` **file**, and **_does not_** **search** for `HTML` **files** to analyze
**_within_** your **project folder**.

`Code Spell Checker` is a **spelling checker** for `source code`. It also
**_works well_** with `camelCase code`.

`Highlight Matching Tag` **_highlights_** `opening` or `closing` **matching
tags**. This extension will **_try_** to **match** from **_anywhere_**:
`tag attributes`, from `inside strings`, any `file`, while also **providing**
**_extensive styling options_** to customize how **tags** are `highlighted`.

These extensions are **_especially useful_** when the `code base/html`
**markup** becomes **_very large_**, and it would become **very difficult** to
**_find errors_** without them!

When you are working on a project, **_take the time_** to **check** for
**_errors_** after **creating** your `code` or `html markup`, and **_use
tools_** such as **these three plugins**, **_along with_** the `EsLint`
(dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) **extension** for `VS Code` by **_Dirk Baeumer_**, and
`Prettier Code Formatter` **extension** for `VS Code` by **_Esben Petersen_**.
Those **_few extra minutes_** you **take** to **_check_** your `code` will
**_save you_** **much time** and **aggravation** in the **_long run_**. Things
can get very sticky when you are going through thousands of **_lines_** of
`code` or `html markup`!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
