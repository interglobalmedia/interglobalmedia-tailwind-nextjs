**_Recently_** **two things** **_happened_** to my `MacBook Pro` (`late`)
`2015`: the **battery** **_expanded_** (and **warped** the **_bottom_**
**piece** of my **computer**) and **_maybe_** as a **result** of the **_first_**
**happening**, the **software** **_related_** to `Spotlight Search` **became**
**_corrupt_**. It **misread** the `free space` on my **computer** (**basically**
that I **_had_** **none** when that **was** SO NOT **the** **_case_**).

I **_finally_** **got back** my **computer**. It **took** the `Mac Repair`
**shop** **_no_** **time** to **fix** the **_first_** **issue** - they
**replaced** the **bottom** (**piece**) of my **computer** where the **battery**
was **located**. It **was** the **_second_** **issue** which **took** them
**forever** to **fix** (just under two weeks), and there was **virtually**
**_no_** **communication** between the **tech** and **myself** **_until_** the
**day** I **_actually_** **got back** the **computer**. I **didn’t** even
**see** his **whole communication** until **_after_** the **fact**.

The **_point_** is, **when** I **rebuilt** my **computer** `application`
**configs** (they **had** to **wipe out** the **software** **_installed_** on my
**computer** and **re-install** it), I **found** that I could **_not_**
**retrieve** certain **music** on my **laptop** that I had **purchased** in the
**iTunes Store** over the (**many**) **years**, but I was **able** to **access**
**_all_** that **music** on my **iPhone**. At **_first_** I **couldn’t** figure
out **why** that was the **case**, but when I **called** `Apple Care`, after
**_some_** **discussion**, we **_both_** **realized** that it was **thanks** to
my **yearly subscription** to `iTunes Match` which **saved** **_me_** and my
**_music_**. `iTunes Match` **keeps track** of what an `Apple Customer` has
**purchased** **_no_** **matter what** their `Apple ID`. I **have been** a
**_very_** **long time** `Apple user/customer`, and `Apple IDs` have been
**ever** **_evolving_**. **Honestly**, I have **forgotten** a **couple** of
`IDs` **_from_** **years ago** along the way. But **once** I **realized** that
**all** I **had** to **do** was **sync** my `iTunes Match` **with** my
`MacBook Pro` **device**, everything was fine!

`iTunes Match` **_only_** **costs** `$24.99/year` (one can **store** up to
`100,000` **songs**!), and it is **worth** **_every_** **penny**. In the
**_long_** **run**, it **saves** **a lot** of **headache**. To **learn more**
about `iTunes Match` and **how** it **works** with `iTunes` (**_now_** called
`Apple Music`), please **visit** the **post**

I will be **embedding** this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with
a **transcript** in the **_form_** of
a **post** on [interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for
your **_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
