I have been executing the `git push -u origin master` command for what seems
like forever now, and knew it was important for **_syncing_** my
`local git repository` with my `remote git repository` when **_pushing_** to
**remote** for the first time, but I never knew the extent of its importance or
the convenience it provided.

The other day I completed a slide deck entitled basic Git commands, and I
researched the `-u` flag. I came across a fabulous website dedicated to `Git`
**commands**, and it went into depth about what `-u` actually does. According to
[jquery-az.com](https://www.jquery-az.com/),

```shell
The -u flag is used to set origin as the upstream remote in your git config. As you push a branch successfully or up to date it, it adds upstream reference.

As you push local branch with (the) git push -u option, that local branch is linked with the remote branch automatically. The advantage is, you may use git pull without any arguments.
```

The key here is in

```shell
The advantage is, you may use git pull without any arguments.
```

So whenever you want to sync your local repo with remote, or want to make sure
that you have incorporated all the changes that other contributors have made to
the repository, you can use

```shell
git pull
```

instead of

```shell
git pull remoteRepositoryUrl
```

It saves you fetching the url from the remote or going into your git config to
retrieve it. This saves much time and inconvenience!

Over the years I have asked people who **_don't_** **use** `git push -u` but
only `git push`, "Don't you have to use the `-u` flag when **_first_** pushing
your local repository to remote?" They would always say, "No. Don't need to, and
never have had any problems". They were always right, but they probably didn't
realize that it meant having to use the `remote url` each time they had to
`git pull`, for example, which meant extra time and some inconvenience. Those
two little characters may be of use to them after all! I know I have **_never_**
had to use the `remote repository url` when `git pulling`!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
