**_Recently_** I had **_updated_** my `MacBook Pro Late 2015` to
`Monterey 12.6`, and it **_wreaked havoc_** on my `MacBook Pro`. Not that
**_things were_** so **_fantastic_** to **_begin with_** (it is **_almost_**
`8 years old` after all), but **_updating_** to `12.6` **_drained down_** my
`battery` **_very quickly_** and **_ate up_** my `memory`. And the `laptop`
started getting **_very hot_** again as a **_result_**. **_a year ago_**,
**_right before_** my `Apple Care` **_expired_**, the `battery` **_swelled_**,
**_screwed up_** the `indexing` so that it **_thought_** I had **_no more
space_** on my **_internal_** `Hard Drive`, so I had to **_very quickly_** get
the `battery` **_replaced_**. I **_went_** to the `iStore`, an `Apple partner`,
and had the `work` **_done there_**. Well, it **_barely lasted_** me a `year`.
**_Barely_**. And the **_job_** was **_really subpar_**. **_Never_** going back
**_there again_**. When they **_first opened_**, it was **_another set_** of
**_guys_**, and they were GREAT. But by `2021`, it was a **_completely
different_** `management` and/or `ownership`. **_At least_** in the `NYC store`.

I **_knew_** I had to **_get over_** to the `Apple Store` at `Grand Central` and
**_get_** a **_new_** `laptop` ASAP, **_before_** things got **_precarious_**.
And I **_did_**! I **_got_** a `MacBook Pro 16 inch`, `2021`, with an
`Apple M1 Max chip`,` 64GB` of `RAM` (a **_dream_**!), and `4TB` **_internal
HD_**. **_However_**, when I **_migrated_** things from my `Intel Mac` over to
the `Silicon M1 Max Chip`, I **_had_** to **_do_** some **_reconfiguration_**!

**_One thing_** which was **_critical_** to me I had to **_re-install_**,
because it is **_installed_** into a new path in `MacBook Pros` on `Monterey`
with the `M1/M1 Max Chip` on `Silicon`. **_At first_** I **_thought_** it was
going to be a **_major deal_**. That I would **_have_** to **_install_** each
`Homebrew package` **_individually_**, and that it would take a **_long time_**
to **_complete_**. But I **_found out_** that **_that_** is NOT the **_case_**!

I **_did_** some **_research_** on **_how_** to **_migrate_** my
`Homebrew configuration` on my **_old_** `MacBook Pro Intel`, and **_came
across_** an **_article_** which **_provided_** the `command` for
**_re-installing_** `Homebrew` on my **_new_** `Mac`, **_fixing_** the path to
the new `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` path (instead of `/usr/local/bin/brew` as it
was **_previously installed_** on my `MacBook Pro Intel`).

**_First_** I **_had_** to **_re-install_** `Homebrew`. In **_addition_**, I
could **_not uninstall_** my **_previous install_** that was **_migrated_** from
my `Intel MacBook Pro`. `macOS` (naturally) could **_not find_** it. I
**_re-installed_** `Homebrew` with the **_following command_**:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**_Next_**, **_after_** the **_install completed_**, I **_got_** something like
the **_following_** back in `Terminal`:

```shell
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/mariacam/.zshrc
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh
```

**_First_** I **_ran_** the `command`:

```shell
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/mariacam/.zshrc
```

And **_then_** I **_ran_** the `command`

```shell
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

And this **_set up_** my `Homebrew install` in `/opt/homebrew/bin`.

But **_then_** I **_had_** to **_make sure_** to **_install_** all those
**_packages_** I **_depended_** on in my `Intel MacBook Pro`. This **_same
article_** explained **_how_** I could **_do it_** in **_one fell swoop_**!

**_Next_**, I **_had_** to **_create_** a **_list_** of the `Homebrew packages`
I **_had installed_** on my `Intel MacBook Pro`. So **_there_**, I **_created_**
a `Brewfile` that **_listed_** all the **_packages_** I had **_installed_** with
`Homebrew` by **_running_** the **_following command_** in `Terminal`:

```shell
brew bundle install --file ~/desktop/Homebrew/Brewfile
```

You **_have_** to **_make sure_** to **_run_** the `command` in the
**_directory_** you **_want_** the `file` to **_appear in_**. I **_created_** a
`Homebrew folder` and **_then_** I **_ran_** the _**above command**_. The
`folder` was for the _**sake**_ of _**ease**_ of `file sharing` from the
_**old**_ `MacBook Pro` to the _**new one**_. `brew bundle install` _**lists**_
all the `Homebrew packages` I _**had installed**_ on the _**old laptop**_ and
_**printed them**_ to the `Brewfile` that was \_\*\*created\*\*\* within the
`Homebrew folder` on my `desktop`.

**_Next_**, I **_had_** to **_make sure_** that I could **_transfer over_** the
`Brewfile` **_from_** my `Intel MacBook Pro` to my **_new_**
`Silicon MacBook Pro`. So I **_first_** went into `File Sharing` on my
`Intel Mac`, and **_selected_** the `Homebrew folder` **_there_** `located` on
my `desktop` and then **_selected myself_** as the `user` for `sharing access`
to **_that folder_**.

**_Then_** I **_went into_** my `Silicon Mac` into `File Sharing` **_where_** I
**_selected_** my `public folder`, and the `Homebrew folder` **_appeared_** on
my `Silicon Mac` **_desktop_**. And then **_all_** I **_needed_** to **_do_**
was to **_run_** the `brew bundle install --file ~/desktop/Homebrew/Brewfile`
**_command_** on my `Silicon Mac`. And **_all_** the **_packages_** were
**_installed immediately_**. I **_had_** to **_remove one_** that would **_not
install_**, and that **_initially resulted_** in a **_failed attempt_** to
**_install_** all **_the packages_**. But **_after_** I **_removed it_** (it was
**_highlighted_** in `red` **_as well_**), I was **_able_** to **_successfully
install_** all the **_other packages_**.

This **_definitely_** made **_re-installing_** `Homebrew` on my **_new_**
`MacBook Pro` with a **_completely different_** `chip` from my **_previous_**
`MacBook Pro` **_very easy_**! I **_highly recommend_** `reading` the
**_article_** I came across **_entitled_**
[Using Homebrew on M1 Mac](https://earthly.dev/blog/homebrew-on-m1/), as it
**_goes into_** the **_background_** and **_reasons_** for **_all_** these
`Homebrew` **_changes_** on the **_new_** `MacBook Pro` with the `M1 Max Chip`
and on `macOS Monterey`.

There is **_still_** a **_lot more_** to **_do_**, but this **_definitely_** was
an **_excellent start_**. **_Especially_** since I **_got_** my **_latest
version_** of `Git` **_back_** (version 2.37.3), **_among other things_**!
