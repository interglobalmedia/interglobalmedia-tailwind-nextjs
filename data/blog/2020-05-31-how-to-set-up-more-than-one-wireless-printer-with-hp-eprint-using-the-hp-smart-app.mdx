I spent most of my time the past week trying to set up a second wireless HP
printer in my apartment. The process was hell for a variety of reasons.

-   **_First_** `Mac compatible Printer` I had `connected` to `HP Smart`:
    `HP Tango X`

-   **_Second_** `Mac compatible Printer` I `connected` to `HP Smart`:
    `Laser Jet Pro M102w`

**_First_**, there was the documentation, or rather lack thereof. **_Second_**,
it was **_hard_** to get a `live person` to **_speak with_** in `HP support`.
Not that support ended up being the complete help I needed! But at **_least_** I
learned all the steps **_by heart_**!

**_Initially_**, it took me forever to `connect` to this **second printer** and
**_add it_** to the `HP Smart app` to begin with, which **_replaced_**
`hpconnected.com`. **_Most_** initial `Google searches` **_pointed_** to the
**old website**, which **_no longer exists_**. **_Only after_** a week of
`searching` and **_trying out_** different `search keywords`, did I finally get
some **_partially_** `relevant information` I was **_looking_** for. The
**_other_** issue which might have **contributed** to the **_complexity_** of
setting up the **_second printer_** is that it was purchased **_for_** us, and
**not** **_by_** us. The **_first_** printer was purchased by **_me_**.

I thought I would share the information I gathered that resulted in a successful
`set-up` of a **_second_** `HP wireless printer`.

**_First_**, you have to **download** the `HP Smart app` to the **_device_** you
want to **connect** your **_printer_** to. I already had **_one_**
`HP Smart printer` **_connected_** to my own `iPhone` and `laptop`, and I did
**_not_** want (and could not) to **connect** a **_second_** `wireless printer`
to those **_same devices_**. Even if I could, it would mean a **_much slower_**
`connection` for **_both_**. As it is, I have **_intermittent_**
`wireless congestion` in **_general_**, so a **_second_** `wireless printer` to
the **_same network_** would have been a **disaster** for **_me_**. Especially
since the printer was **_not meant_** for **my use** in the **_first place_**!

**_After_** you have **downloaded** the app from the
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-smart/id469284907), make sure that
you **_actually_** have **created** an `account` on the
[HP Smart](https://www.hpsmart.com/us/en) `website` **_as well_**. In order for
everything to work **_properly_**, **not** **_only_** do you have to `connect`
your `printer` to the `HP smart app` on a `mobile device` such as an `iPhone` if
you want to **_print_** from a `mobile device` (which you **_should_** want to
do, since that is the **_main point_** of `HP Smart` to **_begin with_**), but
you have to make sure that the `HP Smart website` **_recognizes_** that
**printer** as **_well_**. This step is **_crucial_** to being able to **set
up** an `email address` for the `printer` so that you can **_print_** an
`attachment` using the printer's **_unique_** `email address` from your
**_own_** `email address`. In **_other words_**, you send an `email` to the
printer's **_unique_** `email address` with the `file` you want **_printed_**
`attached` to the `email`. I will explain this in a bit. It's just
**_important_** to **know** **_why_** it is **important** to have an `account`
on the `HP Smart website`.

You can **_also_** set up your `wireless printer` for **printing** off of your
`desktop/laptop` computer **_as well_**. However, I will **_not_** be
**covering** that **_aspect_** in this article.

The **_main purpose_** here is to **discuss** creating a `unique email address`
using HP's `Web Services` so that **_trusted parties_** (or you yourself) can
**send attachments** to your `printer` that are **_subsequently_** printed out
there. This is a `great feature` if you are **_not_** in the same **location**
as your **_printer_**, but a **_remote_** one, and want to **print** to that
**_printer_**, and **read** the **_contents_** at a **later date**. Or perhaps
**_send it_** to **someone** who is at the `printer location` so that **_they_**
can read it.

In **_my_** case, I am able to easily have **_two_** `wireless printers` which
can function in **_tandem_**, because I have **_two_** `wireless networks`
**_set up_**, and can **dedicate** **_one network_** to one `printer`, and the
**_other network_** to another `printer`.

I only found out after **_much struggle_**, that the **_second_** printer had to
be in the **_same room_** as the `network router` in order to be **_able_** to
be **set up** and **_work properly_**. I have `internet capability` in
**_another room_** where I first set up the **_second_** printer, but it was
**_impossible_** to `connect` the **_second_** `wireless printer` properly.
Things took **_forever_**, and the printer oftentimes also `lost connection`.
**_Most important_** was that I was **_not able_** to `create` a
`unique email address` for the **_printer_** from that `location`.

When I **_finally_** figured out **_where_** to **place** the **_second_**
printer, it took **_no time_** to set things up.

It's all about LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION.

**_First_** I set things up **_via_** the `HP Smart app` on an **_another_**
`iPhone` which was **connected** to a `wireless network` **_different_** from my
`iPhone` and `laptop`. Then I had to **_connect_** to `HP Web Services` by
**typing** in the `unique IP address` of the `printer` in the `web address bar`
on the **_associated_** `iPhone`. This **_took me_** to the
`HP Web Services website`.

**_Next_**, I had to make sure that I was in the `HP Web Services` **_tab_**. If
**_not_**, I would have had to **_click_** on it to **_get in_**.

Then I had to **_click_** on an `"Enable Web Services"` **button** **_located_**
in the `HP Web Services` **tab**, and was then **_given_** the `prompt` that a
`printout` of the **printer** `Info Page` was **_being made_**. The page
**_contains_** the **printer** `email address`, and the **printer**
`claim code`, so that you can **_add_** your `printer` to **_your account_** on
the `HP Smart` **website**. It even **_prompts_** you to go to `hpconnected.com`
to **_enter_** the **printer** `claim code` within your **_account_**, and
thereby be able to **manage** your **_printer_**. **_However_**, when you
**type** `hpconnected.com` in the `web browser`, you will be **_re-directed_**
to `hpsmart.com`.

**_Enabling_** `HP Web Services` **_results_** in your `printer` being
`web-connected` and having its **_own_** unique `email address`. The
`email address` **_allows you_** to `email` **file attachments** to your
**_printer_** and **print** from **_anywhere_** at any time. IF you **_want_**
to **print articles** off the `internet`, that is **_touch_** and **_go_** with
this **set-up** and can **take** a **_long time_**, depending on **_which_**
device you `email` **_from_** and how **_far away_** you are **physically** from
the **_printer_**.

For **_example_**, when I **sent** an `email` from my **_laptop_** via my
`gmail account`, **containing** an **_attachment_** which I wanted to **_print
out_**, the `printer` **_received_** the `request` almost **_instantaneously_**.
However, I **_first_** had to **save** the **_article_** in question on my
**desktop** as an `html page` that I **_subsequently_** could **attach** to the
**_email_**. This was **_not_** optimal, as it involved a couple of **_extra_**
steps, and **only text** was **_printed out_**. The **_only_** other way I could
**_possibly_** send the `article` via **_email_**, was by **_copyin_** and
**_pasting_** the **contents** of it into the **_body_** of the `email`. And
**_who knows_** how it would **print out**! That **_also_** would involve
**extra steps** and therefore **_extra time_**.

The **_best way_** to **send articles** for **_others_** to `print out`, is by
**_texting_** the **link** to the `article` via `smart phone`. **_Then_** the
person **receiving** the **_text_** just has to **click** on the **_link_**,
**then** on the `iPhone` **_share icon_**, which **takes them** to **_sharing_**
and/or **_printing options_**:

![iPhone share icon image](/static/images/posts/img/webp/img_3680.webp)

**_Click_** on the `icon` with the `upward arrow`, and it will **_take you_** to
**various options**, **_including_** printing with `HP Smart`, **_located_**
towards the **bottom** of the `iPhone` **screen**. **_Click on_**
`Print with HP Smart`, and it will **_show_** the `individual pages` of the
**_selected_** `web article` (or `document`) to be **_printed_**. **_Click_**
`Print`, and a `progress bar` will **_appear_**, letting you know **_which_**
pages are being **_printed_**, one at a time.

It is **_very_** quick and easy. No fuss. No muss. I am **_including_** the
**_link_** to the `comprehensive documentation` I **_finally_** found
`yesterday` on how to **_set up_** an `HP Smart website account` to **_enable_**
`HP Web Services` for your `wireless printer`. **_This_** `article` in
**_conjunction with_** the `HP Smart documentation` I have **_included_** in the
`Related Resources` **section** of this podcast's `transcript/post` on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) should
be **_all you need_** to **set up** your **_first_** OR **_second_**
`wireless HP printer`.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
