I finally have reached the stage of adding `.mov` files to my **Github**
repositories, and was made aware of the need to use `Git Large File Storage`. I
never thought I would have to download it (with `Homebrew` of course), but the
other morning I finally had to take the plunge.

So what is `Git Large File Storage` (`LFS`)? It is an **_open source_** `Git`
**extension** for **_versioning_** large files. It **_replaces_** **large
files** such as `audio samples`, `videos`, `datasets`, and `graphics` with
`text pointers` inside `Git`, while **_storing_** the **file contents** on a
**remote server** like `Github.com` or `Github Enterprise`.

First I had to **install** the `Git command line` **extension**. I did this with
`Homebrew` by **_typing_** the **following command** in `Terminal` followed by
**_pressing_** the `enter/return` key:

```shell
brew install git-lfs
```

Then I **_executed_** the **following command** in `Terminal`:

```shell
git lfs install
```

I only need to run this once per user account.

In each repository where I want to use `Git LFS`, I select the `file types` I'd
like `Git LFS` to **_manage_**. Or I can **_directly_** edit my `.gitattributes`
file. I have to **_track_** `.mov` files, so I did the following in the
repository I was working on:

```shell
git lfs track "*.mov"
```

Then I make sure to add my .gitattributes to the staging area, and then commit
it.

If you have **_pre-existing_** **files** that you need to **_convert_** to
`Git LFS` **_within_** your **repository**, such as on **other branches** or in
your **_prior_** **commit history** in your **_repository_**, you have to use
the `git lfs migrate[1]` **command**, which has options designed to suit various
use cases.

After you have **_tracked_** the **files** you want to **track** and
**_committed_** the `.gitattributes` file, then you can simply `commit` your
**files** and `push` them to `origin master`. And that is it!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
