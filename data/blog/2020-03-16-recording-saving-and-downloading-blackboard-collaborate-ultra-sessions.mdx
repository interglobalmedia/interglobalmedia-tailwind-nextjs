Today I had a `test session` with a fellow `City Tech` **colleague** to make
sure that everything would go _**smoothly**_ for my `virtual classes` with my
`students` in the _**upcoming weeks**_. I found out that
`Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` is even _**more**_ **cool** than I already
thought, and _**really simple**_ to **use**, once you get to know it. I also
found a `great resource` _**online**_ that helped me get there. I will share the
link in the _**transcript**_ of this **podcast** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/).

The _**following**_ are the **steps necessary** to make a `recording` on
`Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` Screen Sharing, and then to have the
_**ability**_ to **download** the `audio/video` _**afterwards**_:

You have to _**go into**_ `Blackboard` to access `Blackboard Collaborate Ultra`.
For me, I have _**access to it**_ via my **course link** on `Blackboard`.

**First** I have to _**log in to**_ `Blackboard`. For those of us **teaching**
at `City Tech`, the **Home** page looks something like the _**following**_ when
we `log in`:

![Blackboard Home page](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-13.53.04.webp)

There is a `link` in the **bottom left** of the _**screenshot**_ **above**. It
is the `link` to my `Blackboard` _**related**_ `course tools` and `content`. I
have to _**click**_ on it in order to **be able** to _**access**_
`Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` **Screen Sharing** there.

After I have _**clicked**_ on my **course link**, I am taken to my **course
related** _**content**_ and _**tools**_. By _**default**_, I **land** on the
`Announcements` **page**. But what I _**really**_ **want** is to the **left** of
the _**screen**_ under the `title` of my **course**.

![Green Course Content Related Side Bar](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-13.58.50.webp)

_**Within**_ the **green sidebar**, I _**click**_ on the `Tools` **link**. I am
taken to the `Tools` _**available**_ for my **course**:

![Blackboard Course Tools Area](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.00.54.webp)

The _**link**_ to the `Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` is _**right there**_!

Now I have to `click` on the `Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` **link** to _**take
me**_ into **that tool**. When I `click` on the `Blackboard Collaborate Ultra`
**link**, I am taken to the _**following**_:

![Blackboard Collaborate Ultra Create Session Window](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.04.08.webp)

This is where we can _**create**_ our **sessions**!

_**Next**_ I have to `click` on the "Create Session" `button`. This is what the
**window** _**looks like**_ after I have done that:

![Blackboard Collaborate Ultra Event Details Window](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.07.51.webp)

_**Now**_ I have to **create** a `title` for my **session**. You _**won't**_
**be able** to _**save**_ your **session details** until you have _**given**_
the **session** a name! So let's do that _**right now**_.

The **name** I _**create**_ for this **session** (created for the purposes of
this instructional post) is `"Instructional Post Session March 16, 2020"`.

_**Next**_ I want to **make sure** I have _**enabled**_ the **settings** I want
for my _**session**_.

I just _**notice**_ that **after** I _**add**_ a `session name`, the **button**
`"get secure link"` _**appears**_. So I `click` on the `"get secure link"`
**button**, and it _**immediately**_ **switches to** `"Join session"`.

I make _**sure**_ that the `"Guest access"` **checkbox** is _**checked**_.

I **make sure** that `"Participant"` for the `Guest role` is _**selected**_, and
then there is a `Guest` **link** to _**share**_ **with people** you _**want**_
to **participate** in the **session**. It is _**indeed**_ a **secure link** as
_**evidenced by**_ `"https"`.

Next _**comes**_ the `"Event Details"`. You can _**select**_ what **date** you
want your _**session**_ to **take place**, a `start` and `end` **time**, whether
you want it to be an `open session` (with no end) or a `repeat session`.

Then you can _**decide**_ whether **you want** _**people**_ to have
`early entry`. I like to _**choose**_ `"no early entry"` from the `Early Entry`
**dropdown menu**.

You can _**also**_ **provide** a _**description**_ for the **session**. I
_**might**_ actually **do that** for _**my**_ **class sessions** so that my
**students** _**know exactly**_ what was **covered** _**during**_ that
**particular class**. I will probably do the _**same**_ for my **office hour
sessions** _**as well**_.

Next you can _**customize**_ your **session settings** _**within**_ the
`"Session Settings"` **area** towards the _**bottom**_ of the **session
window**. You can `click` on the **dropdown icon** (‚åµ) to _**access**_ the
**session settings**. And this is what is _**available**_ there:

![Session Settings](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.29.55.webp)

There is a `checkbox` for `"Allow recording downloads"`. Make _**sure**_ to
**check it**!

There is a `checkbox` for `"Share audio"`. Make _**sure**_ to **check it**!

There is a `checkbox` for `"Share video"`. Make _**sure**_ to **check it**!

There is a `"Post chat messages"` `checkbox`. Make _**sure**_ to **check it**!
Students _**may want**_ to **post questions** for you to _**answer**_, and you
may _**also**_ **want** to **share information** or even _**links**_ with them!

I _**also**_ **selected** the `"Draw on whiteboard and files"` `checkbox` even
though I _**don't think**_ I will **ever** _**use it**_, but it is _**good**_ to
**do it** in case!

I _**also**_ **checked** the
`"Allow attendees to join the session using a telephone"` even though I **don't
think** _**any**_ of my **students** will _**go that route**_. But _**again**_,
I **check it** just in _**case**_!

I _**don't intend**_ to do any **private chatting** with my _**students**_, but
I want to _**discourage**_ **private chatting** during _**class**_, so I
**check** the `"Moderators supervise all private chats"` so that _**no one**_
will **want** to **set up** a _**private chat**_! They can _**leave that**_ to
`Discord`!

_**Next**_ I **go back** to my `"Event Details"` **section** to _**schedule**_
the **session**. I **want** to _**create**_ a **session** for a few minutes from
now so that I can have a bit of time to complete scheduling it and then joining
the session.

![BlackBoard Session Event Details](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.40.15.webp)

_**First**_ I **choose** `"No early entry"` from the `Early Entry` **dropdown
menu**.

I make the `start date` _**today**_ (3.16.20).

I make the `start time` **2:45pm** (right now it is 2:38 pm, which gives me
plenty of time to complete the session setup). I make the `end time` **2:48pm**.

I _**don't want**_ an `open session`.

I _**don't want**_ a `repeat session`.

Now all I have to do is wait five minutes! But before anything, I **save** the
**session** by _**clicking**_ on the `Save` **button**. When I `click` on the
**button**, I am _**taken**_ to the following:

![Scheduled Session](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.44.41.webp)

When the **time** _**arrives**_, I `click` on the `session link` **above**, and
then `click` on the `Join Session` **button** in the window I am taken to. This
is **what** _**pops up**_ after I `click` on the `Join Session` **button**:

![Session Room Welcome Screen](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.50.02.webp)

_**Next**_ I `click` on the `microphone icon` and then the `video icon` (shown
right above).

Then I `clic`k on the `video icon`, which _**takes me**_ to a `video preview`.
_**There**_, two buttons _**appear**_ under the `video preview`. One is
`cancel`, and the other is `Share video`. `Click` on the `Share Video`
**button**. When you have _**clicked**_ on the `Share video` **button**, you are
_**taken**_ to the following:

![After Clicking Share Video button](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.54.36.webp)

You will see there is a **little window** to the _**bottom left**_ of the
`screenshot` of _**me**_. That means that my `video share` was _**successful**_!

_**Next**_ I `click` on the `little pink double arrow tab` to the **bottom
right** of the _**screen**_. (see above).

![Chat Icon Area](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.56.59.webp)

Now, at the **bottom** to the _**right**_ are `several icons`. The _**first**_
is a `Chat` **icon**, the _**second**_ a `Share Content` **icon**, and the
_**third**_ is your `Audio and Video Settings` **icon**.

The _**default**_ `active icon` is the `Chat` **icon**, as _**shown**_ **right
above**. Now I can `click` on `moderators` (since I am the moderator/professor
of the class), and _**this**_ is what **appears**:

![Moderators Area](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-14.59.43.webp)

There is an `input` to the _**bottom right**_ which has the **placeholder**
`"say something"`. _**There**_, I can _**just chat**_, or I can also
`share links` from _**around**_ the **web**. I choose to **share links** from
_**around**_ the **web**, and _**especially**_ **related to** the topic(s) of
the **lecture**. _**First**_, I may want to **link to** the `slide deck`
_**related to**_ my **lecture**. I will do that now.

![Moderators Area - Shared Link](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.02.43.webp)

As you can see (above), I have _**just**_ **shared** a **link** in the
`Moderators` **chat area**. Now, if I `click` on that link to my `slide deck`
_**hosted**_ on `Github` **gh-pages**, I will be _**taken**_ there, and my
**students** will also _**see**_ the **contents** of the `slide deck`. Now I can
_**start**_ my **lecture**.

![Slide Deck View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.04.25.webp)

If I want to _**share**_ any other **content**, I can _**share**_ more
**links**. This way, they also have `reference` to the `links` _**later**_ when
they `download` the **session**. That's why `chat` is good as well. There is
**written reference** and _**possibly**_ **links** to **content** to _**refer**_
**back to** later.

Next I can `click` on the `Share` icon. I could have done this earlier. In fact,
right at the beginning, if it had been _**appropriate**_.

![Share Content Area](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.07.21.webp)

You see the `"Share Application/Screen"` and then _**below**_ **that**,
`"You are sharing an application"`. _**Before**_ the **second line**
_**appears**_, there is a `"Share Application/Screen"` **button** you have to
`click` if you want to **share** your **screen** with your **session
participants**. Once the **button** has been _**clicked**_, and the `screen`
looks something like the _**above**_, you are good to go! It really does not
matter if you have shared the screen at this point, because that part is only
necessary when you want people to see what is on your screen. Perhaps you were
not even ready until this point. I know that I was not!

The `Audio and Video Settings` looks something like _**this**_:

![Audio and Video Settings Area](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.14.53.webp)

At _**this point**_, the main thing I would want to **adjust** is the `Speaker`
**volume**. It seems that mine is on max here. However, if I want it to be
louder, I could make the volume on my computer louder!

Now I will say something so that I can see how my audio is doing. And then after
that, I will _**end**_ the **session**.

![Open Responsive Menu](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.18.03.webp)

So what I did is `click` on a `hamburger` **icon** (shown in the screenshot
prior to this one), and this is what _**appeared**_ in the `responsive menu`
after **clicking** on the `hamburger icon` (screenshot right above). So what are
the _**options**_ there?

First it says `Start recording`. Well, I didn't do that previously either. So
now I can `click` on `"Start recording"`. All I had set up before, was **sharing
video**. My participants can hear me. I can hear them. But we are _**not**_
**recording** our `session` yet. By **clicking** on `"Record Session"`, and
_**making sure**_ that `screen share` is _**enabled**_, `video share` is
_**enabled**_, and `audio` is _**enabled**_, we are ready to **start**
_**recording**_ our `session`.

In the **screenshot** _**right below**_ here, you will see a **small**
`video camera` **icon** in the **upper left corner** of the **screenshot** with
a `little red dot` in its _**center**_. That **indicates** that a `recording` of
the _**session**_ is `taking place`.

![Recording Session Video Icon](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.23.19.webp)

I don't need to make a long recording of this instructional test of
`Blackboard Collaborate Ultra`. I want to end the session and subsequently leave
it now.

_**First**_ I `click` on the `hamburger icon` again. Then I `click` on
`"Stop Recording"`. Now my screen looks something like this:

![Stop Recording View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.27.28.webp)

As you can see, in the _**top**_ **left corner**, there _**no longer**_ is a
little `video camera` **icon**.

Now I want to _**leave**_ the **session**. I `click` on the `hamburger icon`
again. At the _**bottom left**_ of the `screen` is a **button** called
`"Leave Session"`. I `click` on that to **leave the session**! And this is what
I am taken to as a result:

![Submit Review and Exit](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.29.38.webp)

I was very satisfied with the session, and I select `"Excellent"` and then
`click` the `"Submit and Exit"` **button**.

After I `click` the `"Submit and Exit"` button, I am _**taken**_ to the
**following**:

![Left Session Screen](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.31.35.webp)

This _**confirms**_ that I have **left** my _**session**_!

But now I want to be able to `download` my _**session**_! I **go back** into the
`Blackboard Collaborate Ultra` **tool** for my **course**. I have _**kept**_
that **window** _**open**_ the **whole time** so that I can _**easily**_ **get
back** to it when I need it! As a _**reminder**_, this is what it **looks
like/where it is**:

![Session Ended Blackboard Collaborate Ultra](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.35.29.webp)

Now comes the _**fun part**_! Accessing the `saved video` and **downloading**
_**it**_ to my **laptop**.

_**Again**_, there is a `hamburger icon` (three lines) that you _**have**_ to
`click` on in order to **access** any _**saved sessions**_ for `download`.

When I `click` on the `hamburger icon`, the _**following**_ **appears**:

![Ended Session View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.38.35.webp)

There are _**two links**_ to **choose from** on the _**left**_. The **first** is
`"Sessions"`, and the **second** is `"Recordings"`. I _**choose**_
`"Recordings"`.

A _**very**_ **important detail** to _**remember**_ and **note**: _**just
because**_ you have **recorded** a **session** does _**NOT**_ **mean** that it
will be _**available**_ for **download** _**after**_. You _**must**_ **make
sure** that you **have selected** the `"Allow recording download"` **checkbox**
in _**order for**_ the **recording** to be _**downloadable**_ **later**. For
example, I have a whole bunch of recordings here, but _**only**_ the **most
recent recording** (_**this**_ **current session recording** entitled
`Instructional Post Session March 16, 2020 / recording_1`) is _**available**_
for **download**.

![Recordings View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.43.25.webp)

To the _**right**_, you will see **little circles** with **dots** in the
_**center**_. If you `click` on _**one**_ of **those**, you will get the
_**following**_ **recording options**:

![Download Recording Option View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.45.01.webp)

I _**purposely**_ **clicked** on the _**session**_ I **created** for this
**post** to _**prove**_ a **point**. _**Here**_, there is a **download option**
available. If I `click` on _**that**_, I can `download` the **video** and
_**view**_ it on my `laptop`. However, if I `click` on _**another**_ **circle**
_**related**_ to a **video** which I did _**not**_ make **downloadable**, the
_**following**_ **recording options** will _**appear**_:

![Non-Download Recording Option View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.48.09.webp)

There is _**NO**_ **download option** _**here**_! I know this to be a
_**fact**_, because I **never tried** to make _**any**_ of my **previous
lectures** _**downloadable**_. However, I _**did**_ **record them**.

When I `click` on the **download option** for _**this**_ **session**, I am
_**taken**_ to my `downloads` **area** on my `laptop` and the _**following**_
**appears**:

![Successfully Downloaded Recording View](/static/images/posts/img/webp/screenshot-2020-03-16-15.50.13.webp)

And _**success**_! I have **successfully** _**downloaded**_ my **session**!

On _**another**_ **note**, `Discord` is **currently undergoing** _**massive**_
**server outages**. _**Many**_ of **us** will _**not**_ **be able** to _**get
in**_ **for a while**. That _**means**_ I will be **making** an _**increased
number**_ of **announcements** on `Blackboard` to _**communicate**_ with my
**students**! _**Thank God**_ for `Github` as _**well**_!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
_**transcript**_ in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
_**hearing**_ and _**reading**_ pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
