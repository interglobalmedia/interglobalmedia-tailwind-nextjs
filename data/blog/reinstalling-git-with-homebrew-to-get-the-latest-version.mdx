![Reinstalling Git with Homebrew to Get the Latest Version](/static/images/posts/img/webp/pexels-brett-sayles-7146867.webp)

**Note**: You have to already have `Homebrew` [installed](https://brew.sh/) in
order to install `Git` with `Homebrew`.

Yesterday I **_updated_** `Xcode` on `macOS Monterey`, and **_found out_** that
it did **_not include_** the **_latest version_** of `Git`. So I **_decided_**
to **_re-install_** it with `Homebrew`, if I **_could_**.

I **_could_**, and I **_did_**, but it **_involved_** a **_bit_** of a
**_hack_**. Since `macOS El Capitan`, we are **_not able_** to **_make
changes_** to the `bin` **folder** due to `SIP`
(`System Integration Protection`) on our `Macs`. We have to **_disable_** it and
then **_re-enable_** it **_after making_** the `changes` we **_need_** to
`make`. I did **_not want_** to **_have_** to **_go through_** the `process` of
**_doing this_** if I could **_avoid_** it, and it would **_have meant_** more
time in **_doing so_**. **_Instead_**, **_before_** I **_re-installed_** `Git`
with `Homebrew`, I **_created_** an `alias`:

```shell
alias git='/usr/local/bin/git'
```

I **_ran_** the **_above_** `command` in `Terminal`. Then I `"re-installed"`
**Git** with `Homebrew`. I **_came across_** the **_steps_** to **_do so_** in a
`Github Gist`, and the `alias` **_workaround_** as **_well_**. To **_read
through_** this `Gist`, please **_visit_**
[Re-installing Git on Mac OSX with Brew](https://gist.github.com/brandonsimpson/54d9e085c9fde5e6ad3a)
on `Github`. I **_found_** the `alias` **_suggestion_** from **_within_** the
`comments`.

The `alias` **_worked_** for me and was **_much quicker_** to **_implement_**,
so I **_stuck_** with it. I **_ran_** the **_following_** `commands` to
**_install_** `Git` with `Homebrew`:

```shell
brew uninstall git
brew update
brew install git
```

The **_first_** `command` did **_nothing_** for me, **_because_** I did
**_not_** previously install `Git` with `Homebrew`. I **_ran_** the **_second_**
`command` to **_update_** `Homebrew` (**_always recommended_** before installing
something with `Homebrew`). And the **_third_** `command` **_actually
installed_** `Git` with `Homebrew`.

**_Happy_** `distributed version control` with `Git`!
