I **_just_** `came across` a `tweet` which I **_consider_** the **_best one_** I
have **_come across_** in a while. It is **_also something_** that we **_all
should_** be **_asking ourselves_**: `"Do you have a brain?"`. And it
**_continues with_** `"Share your tips on how best to use it ðŸ‘‡"`. We
**_should_** ALL **_ponder_** over **_how_** we actually **_do_** `use` our
`brains`, and **_over what_**. `Young people`, `students`, or **_just starting
out_** in **_their lives_** and `careers` **_as adults_**, as well as
**_those_** `later on` in `life`, EVERYONE, **_should_** ALL **_ask ourselves_**
that `question` and **_ponder over_** `how` we DO **_use_** our **_brains_**.

**_The_** `tweet`:
