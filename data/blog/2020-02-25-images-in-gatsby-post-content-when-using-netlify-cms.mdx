Today I finally figured out how to _**add**_ **images** to the body of
`Gatsby markdown posts` when using the `Netlify CMS`. It's easy, but _**not**_
intuitive. No one seems to ever talk about the process, but so many ask how it
is done!

![Netlify CMS Backend Media Tab](/static/images/posts/img/webp/netlify-cms-backend-media.webp)

After some trial and error, I finally found that all I had to do was _**first**_
**upload** the **image** to my `Netlify CMS` **backend** that I wanted to use in
the body of a post. To do this, I _**click**_ on the `Media` **tab** in the
`CMS backend`, and _**upload**_ a **new image**.

![Netlify Static Image Deployment](/static/images/posts/img/webp/netlify-static-img-deploy.webp)

Next I _**wait**_ for my `automated deploy(ment)` to complete. While that is
happening, I _**add**_ the `image` via `markdown` in my either _**already**_
`published article`, or _**wait**_ till the `image deployment` has
**completed**, **create** a _**new**_ **blog post** including the `path` to the
`image` using `markdown` inside the `post content body`, and then `push` the
`changes` to `Github master`. _**However**_, whichever way I do it, I have to
_**make sure**_ to `git pull` **changes** made _**first**_ on
`remote Netlify CMS` _**before**_ **committing** and _**pushing**_ my
`local changes`. And that is it! This is how I added an image to one of my
posts:

```markdown
![Git File Large Storage](/static/images/posts/img/webp/git-large-file-storage.webp)
```

What this is saying is that my `git-large-file-storage.png` **png** resides in
an `img` **folder** inside of my `static` **folder**:

```html
static/img/git-large-file-storage.png
```

But I _**don't**_ have to **add** the `static` **path**, because `Netlify CMS`
knows to _**look**_ **inside** the `static` **folder** and _**retrieve**_ **blog
post** `images` there. So the path is _**stating**_ that `Netlify CMS` can find
this `image` _**inside**_ the `img` **folder** in the **parent** `static`
**folder**. And that is it!

file, please visit the:

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
_**transcript**_ in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
_**hearing**_ and _**reading**_ pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
