Previously I wrote a couple of articles about how one can convert images from on
type to another either using Command Line commands or specifically using the
cwebp package available through Homebrew. But let’s say the macOS user does not
have Xcode and/or CLT (Command Line Tools for Xcode) installed or configured?

Not a problem. Those macOS users can achieve the same or at least similar goals
by using their Finder app.

The steps are real simple. First click on the Finder app to open it. It looks
like the following and it is located within your Dock on macOS:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia

	alt="Finder app icon located on macOS dock"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/png/Finder_Icon_macOS_Big_Sur.png"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

Mine is located all the way to the left of the Dock, which is located at the
bottom of my MacBook Pro screen. My Dock looks like the following:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/macos_dock.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="macOS dock on Macbook Pro screen"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/macos_dock.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

After you click on the Finder app to open it, something like the following will
appear:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_desktop_view.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder app desktop view"
	srcUrl="static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_desktop_view.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

When I opened my Finder, “Desktop” was highlighted, because that is the last
location I visited when I used the Finder. And conveniently enough, a jpeg image
was highlighted. So I will use that image as an example. I will convert it to a
png.

Next, I click on the image I want to convert (in this case, the one that is
highlighted in the screen capture), and then I select export. When I open the
image by clicking on it, it should look something like the following:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_shot.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder preview shot"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_shot.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

Next, I go into the File tab for Finder, which is located at the top of my
MacBook Pro screen (same difference across macOS devices), and select “Export”.
It should look something like the following:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_export.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder previer file export"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_export.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

Then I actually click on “Export”, and something like the following appears:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_save_as.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder preview file save as"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_save_as.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

Here, the png format is shown, because that is the last format I selected `for`
transforming a jpg image to a png image. However, other formats are available.
They are the **_following_**:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_formats.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder preview file formats"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_formats.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

The only two formats most people should concern themselves with are the jpg and
png formats. I will be writing another post regarding the formats available here
to acquaint my readers about what function they serve.

The other option available within this popup is where one wants to save the
transformed image. It looks something like the following:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_save_as_location.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder preview file save as location"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_preview_file_save_as_location.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

I want to keep the same location, so I select `Desktop - iCloud”` `for` the file
format, I select “png”. Then I click on the “Save” button and close the popup.
Then, when I look `for` it on my Desktop, the following appears in my Finder:

<br />
<Interglobalmedia
	src="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_desktop_view_png.webp"
	author="Maria D. Campbell"
	alt="Finder desktop view png"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/finder_desktop_view_png.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

I didn’t even have to look for it on my Desktop! I just had to find the new png
file that was created right at that moment (I confirm by comparing the creation
time with the actually time on my macOS clock). And that is it!

It is important to note that when you save the image to a new file format, it is
being “Saved As”, so a new copy of the image in its new format is being saved,
so it does not overwrite the original file.

_Happy image file conversion!_
