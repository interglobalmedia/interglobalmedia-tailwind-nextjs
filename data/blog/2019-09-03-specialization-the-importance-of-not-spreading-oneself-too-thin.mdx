It's been a little while since my last podcast. I have been a bit busy and have
also been working on my **presentation** for
[Code Camp 2019](https://codecampnyc.org/)! It started as a problem solving
quest and became a **Code Camp** submission. I submitted the proposal a few days
ago and am awaiting confirmation. Wish me luck on the submission and hopefully I
will be seeing some of you there this year! It **takes place** in **_NYC_** on
**Saturday, October 12, 2019**. Looking forward to hearing others speak as well!

On another note, I wanted to share a couple of tweets I came across on Twitter
which I think are very important for you to hear. They come from **Cory House**,
**Twitter handle** [@housecor](https://twitter.com/housecor).

The **_first_**:

> Example: Every skill I choose to learn means I have less time to go deeper on
> the skills I already know. I specialize in front-end dev. That means I have to
> say &quot;no&quot; to many opportunities. The opportunity cost of going too
> wide: I wouldn&#39;t have time to go deep in my speciality.

I have always believed in the **concept** of **_"specialization"_**, and now
more than ever. How else does one stand out from the rest of the pack? And
believe me, the pack is HUGE.

The **_second_**:

> One of the most valuable concepts I learned in school: Opportunity cost - The
> loss of potential gain from other options when an option is chosen. This is
> why getting comfortable with saying &quot;no&quot; is important. Every
> &quot;yes&quot; is an implicit &quot;no&quot; to something else.

And just now I came across another tweet which I think fits well in the realm of
helping one determine which specialty one should focus on. It came from Cerebral
Wisdom, Twitter handle `@CerebralWisdom`. It goes as follows:

> The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything
> to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard
> the first lesson of economics. - Thomas Sowell
>
> &mdash;
> [Cerebral Wisdom (@CerebralWisdom) - August 30, 2019](https://twitter.com/CerebralWisdom/status/1167343703087706112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

We're not discussing politics here, so the second half of the tweet is not
relevant to the topic at hand. It's all about **_specializing_** in something
which one **loves**, is **_passionate_** about, **_excels_** at, and of which
there is a **"scarcity"** of **skill**. **Economics** **_directly applies_** to
**skillsets** too.

> There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it.

Let's examine a real world (non-tech related) example. Let's say I wanted to get
into pet sitting and consultation on the side to make some extra bucks because I
have a passion for animals. However, sitting for a large variety of them would
mean only skin deep knowledge of all and never gaining a deep understanding of
one. So I choose the cat (I have been a big cat lover since I can remember and
they take a tremendous shining to me as well). But perhaps there are many others
offering their services as cat sitters, so how do I differentiate myself from
the rest? Perhaps I choose to sit for and provide consultation regarding single
cat households as the skillset for cat sitting a single cat is very different
from sitting for two or more. Get the picture? Perhaps within the specialty we
choose there is a sub-specialty that can make us "stand out" from the rest.

And the **third tweet** from [@housecor](https://twitter.com/housecor) which
especially resonates with me and which I had discovered about myself as well:

> Looking back, the moment my life turned around for the better: I finally
> stopped doing the things I assumed others expected me to do...And I started
> doing the things that I believed in.
>

I will be embedding this **episode** of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the **_form_** of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. I will be including the related
resource links mentioned in the podcast of course. Always do. Bye for now!
