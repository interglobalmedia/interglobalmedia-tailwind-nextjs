It is **_very simple_** to **_connect_** to one’s **_local_**
`MongoDB databases` **_using_** `MongoDB Compass`. All you **_need_** to do is
**_connect_** to your (new) `mongosh shell` **_via_** `Terminal`. I
**_installed_** my **_instance_** of the `mongoldb-community`’s **_latest
version_** (`6.0.1`) **_using_** `Homebrew`. So to **_start_** the
`mongoldb-community service` with `Homebrew`, I **_first run_** the **_following
command_**:

```shell
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**_Next_**, I **_run_** the **_following command_**:

```shell
mongosh
```

**_Then_** I **_run_** the **_following command_** to **_see_** what `databases`
I **_have locally_**:

```shell
show dbs
```

**_Then_** I **_use_** the **_following command_** to **_switch_** to the
`database` I **_want_** to **_use_**:

```shell
use bookit
```

In **_my case_**, I **_switch_** to a `database` called `bookit`.

**_Then_**, I **_go into_** `MongoDB Compass` **_intalled_** on my `computer`,
and I **_start_** a **_new connection_**. When I **_open up_** `Compass``, it
**_looks like_** the **_following_**:

	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/mongodb-compass-new-connection.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

And, as you can **_see_** within the `screenshot`, I have **_entered_** my
`localhost url`, so **_all_** I **_have_** to **_do_** is **_click_** on the
`Connect button`. And **_when_** I **_do so_**, the **_following appears_**:

	alt="Connected to MongoDB Compass"
	srcUrl="/static/images/posts/img/webp/mongodb-compass-connected.webp"
	authorUrl="/about"
/>

**_Then_**, I **_just click_** on the `database`` of **_my choice_** in the
**_sidebar_** to the **_left_**. And **_that_** is **_it!_**

**_Happy MongoDB Compassing!_**
