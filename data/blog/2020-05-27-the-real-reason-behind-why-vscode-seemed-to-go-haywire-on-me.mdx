A couple of weeks ago, when I launched one of my projects with `VS Code`'s
`Live Server`, everything seemed so **_small_** and **_unintelligible_** all of
a sudden. I couldn't figure out why things were rendering so queerly in the
browser. Because I could not figure out the culprit, I **_switched_** over to
`WebStorm`.

I do love `WebStorm` for **_some_** things, but I also **_love_** `VS Code` for
others. Depending on what I am working on, I **_might_** **prefer** one Code
Editor over the other.

But I do love the **_ease_** of **access** and **_use_** of VS Code. Lately I
found myself using it just do quick checks, and kept on opening `Live Server` to
see whether the situation there had changed. Then by accident, I went into
`Chrome`'s `View Tab`, and came across the **_option_** `"Actual Size"`. I
**_clicked_** on it, and everything went back to normal. I never remembered
changing the view size in `Chrome` or anywhere else, but was glad that I finally
was able to resolve the issue. What's **_strange_**, however, was that the
**problem** **_only_** appeared `locally` when I was using `VS Code` and
**_not_** when I subsequently used `WebStorm`. On a **_remote server_**, things
rendered as expected. Go figure.

So if you use `VS Code` and `Chrome`, and **_suddenly_** everything in the
`browser` seems **_very small_** and **_strange_**, just **click** on the
`View tab` when in `Chrome`, and select the `"Actual Size"` option.

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
