## Description

An `application` I **_created_** at the **_height_** of the `COVID-19 pandemic`
as **_part_** of the `course content` of a `Dynamic Web 1` (`JavaScript`)
**_course_** I was (and **_still am_**) teaching. We had **_just migrated_** to
`online learning`, and I **_wanted_** to **_create_** an `application` that
**_visualized_** what **_we_** were **_all feeling_**. I **_selected images_**
that **_expressed_** those **_feelings_**, and **_synched_** the
**_animations_** with the `beat` of `music` I **_chose_**. It was a **_rough
time_**, but **_my students_** for **_that class_** were **_really amazing_**. I
was **_truly inspired_** by **_them_**.
