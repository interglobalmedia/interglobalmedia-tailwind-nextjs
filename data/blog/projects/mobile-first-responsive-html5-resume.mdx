During this **_final_** `COMD2451 Web Design 1` **_class_** I am
**_teaching_**/**_taught_** at the **New York City College of Technology** (
**_aka_** **CityTech**) in **_Brooklyn_**, I **_finally_** took out the `time`
to **_refactor_** the `CSS code` for a **_mobile first_** `HTML5 resume` we
**_built_** for our `professional portfolio sites` and **_made it_** a
`100% mobile first` **_designed_** `HTML5 page`. I had **_originally
refactored_** the **_responsive_** `HTML5 resume` I had **_found_** on
`Codepen`, and **_made it_** as `"dry"` **_as possible_** within my **_time
constraints_**. But **_since_** this was going to be my **_last class_** I was
**_teaching_** at `CityTech`, I **_thought_** a **_great way_** of
`"wrapping things up"` and `"tying up loose ends"` would be to **_make_** the
**_design_** `100%` **_"mobile first"_**. **_Because_** the **_original_**
`CSS code` was **_NOT_**, and I (**_originally_**) **_pointed_** out **_why_**
in the `slide deck`, **_line_** by **_line_**. It was a **_great_** and
**_challenging_** `refactoring` **_experience_**, and I **_also updated_** the
`slide deck` for the **_class session_** to **_reflect_** those **_changes_**.
It was also a **_great experience_** and **_take way_** for the `students`!
