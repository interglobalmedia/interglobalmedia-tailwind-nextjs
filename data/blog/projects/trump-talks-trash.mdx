## Description

A `Random Quote API Application` using the `What Does Trump Think? API`. I **_created_** a `Nodejs` app **_using_** the `ejs` (`embedded javascript`) `view engine` for `Express`, a `minimalist framework` for `Nodejs.` I was only using one image which was not large, and there were no fancy animations involved. I use the `fetch() API` method **_instead_** of `AJAX`.

### Project Includes

`ejs`, `express`, `fetch api`, `nodejs`, `random quote api`
