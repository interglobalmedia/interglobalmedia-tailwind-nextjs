## Description

**_Formerly_** a `Random Quote API Application` using the
`What Does Trump Think? API`. I **_previously_** **_created_** a `Nodejs` app
**_using_** the `ejs` (`embedded javascript`) `view engine` for `Express`, a
`minimalist framework` for `Nodejs.` I was **_only_** using **_one image_**
which was **_not large_**, and there were **_no_** `fancy animations`
**_involved_**. I **_used_** the `fetch() API` method **_instead_** of `AJAX`.

**_Suffice_** it to **_say_**, `Heroku` since that time was **_taken over_** by
`Salesforce`, and they have slowly **_been trying_** to **_edge out_** anyone
who is **_not part_** of the `company`. **_In addition_**, there `have been`
**_a number_** of `hacker attacks` in the **_last year_** or so, so I did
**_not_** `feel comfortable` **_using_** the `platform` **_anymore_**!

**_Lately_**, I have been doing a **_deep dive_** into `Next.js`, so I
**_decided_** to **_build_** `this app` **_using_** `Next.js` **_instead_**. And
I am **_so happy_** that I **_did!_** **_Much less_** `code`, **_fewer files_**,
**_fewer dependencies_**, **_no_** `full page reloads` (**_which happened_**
with `ejs`), and **_lots_** of **_fun_** `figuring out` **_how_** to **_make_**
the `API` **_work_** with **_something new_**!

**_One thing_** that was a **_really cool_** `design challenge` **_regarding_**
this `application`, was to **_make sure_** that my `"Next Quote"` `button` did
**_not jump_** whenever I **_clicked_** on it to **_get_** the `next quote` from
the `API`. I **_also wanted_** to **_make sure_** that the `quote container`
also did **_not bounce_** all over the place, while **_making sure_** that the
`application` was **_still_** `completely responsive`. I **_think_** the
`solution` I **_came up_** with is **_pretty darn good!_** **_Check_** it
**_out_** and **_let_** me **_know!_** You can **_leave_** a `comment` via
`Giscus` at the **_bottom_** of **_this post_** by **_clicking_** on the
`"Load Comments"` `button` and **_submitting_** a `comment` there.
