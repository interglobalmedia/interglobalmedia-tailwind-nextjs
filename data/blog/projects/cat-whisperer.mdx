    A little text to speech app I created so that cat lovers could be inspired

    inspired by the app’s cat image slideshow.

## Description

This is a project in which I **_merge together_** my (original) `Cat Whisperer`
project, `Speech Synthesis`, `audio`, and a cool `image fader` **_animation
effect_** I **_apply_** to my `images` of my (**_late_** cat) `Percy`.

This is a **_little_** `speech to text` **_app_** I **_created_** so that
`cat lovers` could be **_inspired_** to **_write about_** their `cats` using the
`Speech Synthesis API` while being **_inspired_** by the app’s
`cat image slideshow`. There is **_also_** `music` if one **_wants_** to
**_listen_** while **_writing_**. The user’s `text` is **_saved_** to
`session storage`. If the user **_reaches_** the `5mb limit`, he/she can
**_save_** it to a `.txt` file and `download` it.

## Project Includes

`cat whisperer`, `es6 javascript`, `eslint`, `es6 modules`, `file downloads`,
`htm5 audio`, `session storage`, `speech synthesis api`, `text to speech`,
`web audio api`, `webpack`

## Refactoring The App

**January 8, 2019**: A **_lot_** has happened in terms of `JS workflows` since I
**_created_** this `app`. Since I want to potentially develop this app further,
as well as (continue to) display it in my portfolio, I knew I had to update the
code here. That **_especially means_** `updating` the `workflow`!

So I have **_applied_** an `adaptation` of my **_latest_** `React workflow`
using `Webpack 4` and `Babel 7` to this application. A **_whole new_** `set` of
`tools` for `automation`!

I **_also replaced_** `local storage` with `session storage`.

I also wrote a quick piece on my experience refactoring this app (yesterday)
that is available for your reading pleasure on my
[Developer Blog](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/blog/refactoring-your-js-workflow-when-your-images-are-in-your-css-only/).
