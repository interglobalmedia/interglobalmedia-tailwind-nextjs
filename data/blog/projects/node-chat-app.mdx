## chattr

## Built with websockets library socket.io, Node.js, and Express, and React

### What is it for?

-   For friends, family, and/or colleagues to connect in real time and
    communicate with each other. Messages were **timestamped**. **chattrbox**
    used to also use the
    [geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
    and
    [Google Maps API Maps Url](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/guide).
    The **geolocation API** allowed users to provide their location IF they want
    to. They can always choose to **DENY** access to their location. For privacy
    reasons, the user was asked permission to report location information when
    clicking on the **Send Location** button. **chattrbox** used the **Google
    Maps API** along with the **geolocation API** so that a user not only shared
    his/her **latitude** and **longitude**, but an actual **Google Map** with
    his/her exact **location** and **directions** how to get there. That was
    possible because of the implementation of **Google Maps API** **dir**
    (directions) mode as opposed to **search** mode, which was a bit less
    **accurate**.

    **_However_**, in this **_current iteration_** of the `application`, I
    **_chose not_** to **_add_** the `Google Maps API` and `geolocation API`
    features because of the **_increased awareness_** and **_global support_**
    of `individuals' privacy` on the `web`. `Messages` are also **_no longer_**
    `timestamped` for the **_same reason_**.

### Are chats private?

-   It **_used_** to **_be_** that `chats` in **_each_** `chat room` that was
    **_created_** by a `user` when `he/she` **_logged in_**, **were** `private`
    **_within_** the **_confines_** of that `room`. **_However_**, **_now_**
    there are **_no longer_** `private chat rooms`, but `private chats`
    **_between_** `two users` at a `time`.

### If every user can create their own private chat, how does that work?

-   **_Each socket_** in `Socket.io` is **_identified_** by a `random`,
    `unguessable`, **_unique identifier_** `Socket#id`. Therefore, each socket
    automatically joins a `"room"` **_identified by_** its `own id`. This
    **_makes_** it **_easy_** to **_create_** `private messages` **_between_**
    `two users/browser window (tab) instances`. I **_found this_** to be a
    **_better use_** of **_this_** `Socket.io` _**feature**_ than _**creating**_
    a `room` that `multiple users` can _**join**_. _**As**_ a _**result**_, one
    can _**create**_ `either` a `public chat` in which the `messages` are
    _**shared**_ with `everyone` _**everywhere**_, or _**create**_ a
    `private chat` _**with**_ `one user` _**at**_ a **_time_**.

### How can I tell whether I am creating a private or public message?

-   **_Once_** you have **_entered_** your `name` in the `input field`
    **_containing_** the `placeholder text` `"Enter name"` and **_hit_** the
    `return/enter key` on your `device's keyboard`, your `name` **_appears_**
    among the `list` of `users` who have **_also joined_** `Chattr`, **_if_**
    `there are` **_any_**. If there is **_at least_** `one other user`
    **_present_**, you can `click` on their `name`, and you will be
    **_directed_** to an `input field` **_containing_** the `placeholder text`
    `"Type your message (private)"`. **_In addition_**, when you `click` on the
    `user` you **_want_** to **_have_** a `private chat` with, their `name`
    **_will become_** `underlined`, **_indicating_** they are the `current`
    (`selected`) `user` you are **_chatting_** with **_privately_**. An
    `input field` **_with_** the `placeholder text`
    `"Type your message (public)"` also **_appears_** when you **_first_**
    `input` your `name` in the `input field` **_with_** the `placeholder text`
    `"Enter name"`, which is **_present_** when you **_first land_** on the
    `application`.

### How can I invite others to chat with me?

-   By sharing the link to the site.

### Are chats persistent?

-   **_No_**. **_Once_** a `browser tab` or `window` is **_closed_**, the `user`
    **_associated with_** that `tab` or `window instance` is **_erased_** along
    with **_any_** `messages` **_associated with_** the `user`. But you can
    **_re-use_** the `link` to the `application` on `Heroku` i**_f you like_**
    and **_share_** it **_with others_** so that they can **_join you_** there.

### Will the url always remain the same?

**It could**, but I **_might_** change it **from time to time** at my
**_discretion_** so as to **_prevent abuse_** of the `site` for
**_potentially_** `nefarious reasons` or `for profit`. I **_will share_** the
`url` **_only_** `with those` that I **_would like_** to **_share_** the `space`
**_with_**.
