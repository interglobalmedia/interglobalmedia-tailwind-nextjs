The other day, one of my students was having **_problems_** **pushing** his
**local repository** `source code` to his **_remote_** `Github repository`. He
also needed **guidance** in **_organizing_** his `repository content`.I
**_worked_** **with him** in **_organizing_** his `repository content` into
**_different_** **folders** by doing the following:

- I forked his repository. Yes! Forking was revisited!

- I git cloned the fork to my laptop.

- I made the necessary organizational changes to the project content.

- I made sure to git pull upstream master (the branch in question) for
  (potential) changes that might have been made by him on remote after my last
  upstream update without my knowledge.

- I pushed my changes to my forked repository.

- I created a pull request on his original repository.

- He merged that pull request.

The `key` to all this is, that we `coordinated` the `pull request`. I **_made
sure_** that he did **not push** any more **changes** to **_remote_**, because
that **might have** **_resulted_** in **merge conflicts**! After he **_merged_**
the `pull request`, he could **continue** **_pushing changes_** to **remote**
**_without_** **having to worry** that I **_might_** be **making changes** to
the **same content** in my **_forked repository_**, and then **create** a
`pull request`.Road blocks **_organically evolved_** into his **learning more**
about a `skill` **_essential_** to any `designer`, `developer`, or **_any
other_** `role` in `technology` today. Git. It also **_indirectly_** AND
**_directly_** helps one **become** a **_better_** `designer`, `developer`, or
**other** `related technology role`. I love it when `evolution` of any sort is
**_organic_**! It just **_naturally_** **happens**. And that **_comes from_**
`collaborative effort` on **both sides** and a **_willingness_** (AND
**_eagerness_**) to **learn**. Most **_important_** of all, to **get the job
done** within a **_certain time frame_**!

I will be embedding this episode of **Plugging in The Holes** along with a
**_transcript_** in the form of a **post** on
[interglobalmedianetwork.com](https://www.interglobalmedianetwork.com/) for your
**_hearing_** and **_reading_** pleasure. Bye for now!
