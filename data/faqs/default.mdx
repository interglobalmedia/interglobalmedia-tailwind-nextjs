> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**What is the best browser to view this site with?**</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">Pretty much anything but Chrome. It is not a matter of cross-browser issues or anything like that. For anyone who has been following this site for a while, there might be cache issues. You still might be seeing the old site when you first land on the page. If you are seeing a lot of yellow, you are viewing the old site. If you see a lot of hot pink and bright blue teal, you are viewing the newly revamped site. To clear the cache in Chrome, perform a hard refresh. On macOs, this is achieved by pressing the shift key followed the refresh key located to the left of the address bar. Only then will you successfully clear the cache!</b>

Perhaps you are stuck on an issue in your web site or application you can't solve, and perhaps don't have the time to focus on it. Perhaps you need site or application maintenance, updating, or refactoring. Perhaps you just need to have something built! And so on.</b>

> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**What kinds of applications or sites does Maria build?**</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">Maria's specialty stack is JavaScript. Front and back. However, she also works with WordPress (which also includes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), and uses her own custom theme. She can also provide a commmunity add-on to WordPress web sites. And coming from digital photography and video, she likes to work with digital media features within her sites and/or applications.</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">Maria is available for one-on-one instruction for the same subject matter she teaches in the classroom. Just as in the classroom, this would include how to build your own (basic) static website and how to host it on a remote hosting service. Everyone should have some sort of online presence other than just social media. And because we are becoming more and more dependent on technology, everyone should have a certain level of technical knowledge and skills. You never know when you might need them for work OR in your personal life. Having such an edge can only increase your (self) worth!</b>

> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**Does Maria teach anything other than web development?**</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">YES. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, she found that there were a lot of people in her environment who had become isolated because of their lack of technical knowledge or access, so she began offering private macOS computer and iOS classes. The subject matter was structured around the individual needs of each student.</b>
