Or **_perhaps_** you **_need_** to `acquaint yourself` with your **_computer_**'s `operating system` (`OS`) or `computer` in **_general_** (**_current OS_**: `macOS Monterey Silicon`, but **_very soon_** to be `Ventura Silicon`). And **_so on_**.</b>

> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**What kinds of applications or sites does Maria build?**</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">Maria's `specialty stack` is `JavaScript`. `Front` and`back`. **_However_**, she **_also works_** with `WordPress` (which **_also includes_** `JavaScript`,` HTML`, and `CSS`), and **_uses_** her **_own_** `custom theme`. She can **_also provide_** a `commmunity add-on` to `WordPress` **web sites**. And **_coming from_** `digital photography` and `video`, she **_likes_** to **_work_** with `digital media features` **_within_** her `sites` and/or `applications`.</b>

> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**Where does Maria teach?**</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">She is **_currently_** an `Adjunct Professor` at `New York City College of Technology` in `Brooklyn, N.Y`. AKA `CityTech`. She is **_teaching_** `Web Design` and has **_taught_** `Front End JavaScript` with a **_sneak peak_** into `Node.js` in the **_past_**. **_However_**, because of `COVID 19` and **_high risk individuals_** that she **_lives with_**, as well as **_wanting_** to make herself **_available_** to a **_bigger basket_** of **_opportunities_**, she will **_not_** be **_going back_** to **_teach_** in the `Spring` of `2023`.

She **_believes_** that **_everyone_** should have **_some sort_** of `online presence` **_other than_** just `social media`. And **_because_** we are **_becoming_** more and more **_dependent_** on `technology`, **_everyone_** should have a **_certain level_** of `technical knowledge` and `skills`. You **_never know_** when you**_ might need_** them for` work` OR in your **_personal life_**. Having such an **_edge_** can **_only increase_** your (`self`) `worth`!</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">YES. When the `COVID-19 pandemic` **_hit_**, she **_found_** that there were a **_lot_** of `people` in her `environment` who had **_become isolated_** because of their **_lack_** of `technical knowledge` or `access`, so she **_began offering_** `private macOS computer` and `iOS classe`s. The `subject matter` is **_structured around_** the **_individual needs_** of **_each student_**.</b>

> -   ## A. <b className="faqs-b text-base">YES. **_To comment_**, you **_must authorize_** `Giscus` to **_post_** on **your behalf** `using` the **Github OAuth flow**. You can **_also choose_** to **_comment_** on the `site`'s `Github Discussion` **_directly_**.</b>

> -   ## Q. <b className="faqs-b text-base">**When does the Giscus authorization process take place?**</b>
